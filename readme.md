Using [this](https://swapi.co/documentation#starships) awesome api. Thanks!

## Next steps
### Will try to do
1. Detail page for every starship
2. Include images in detail page (probably with google API)
3. Improve responsiveness and loading times
4. Deploy to public (on raspberry, for example)

### Maybe
- Add animations, just for fun
- Improve design, if I can think of something better
- Add vehicles
- Filters on list view
